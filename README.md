# {{GROUP_NAME}} {{GROUP_TYPE}} Group
<!--
 This is the template for creating project groups in rust-lang. Be sure to go
 through all sections marked with `**FIX ME**`, and make sure that the text is
 correct, and feel free to replace/remove any part that's not relevant to
 your group.

 All of the text across all of the initial files uses the same group of
 variables to allow for easy search and replace. They are listed below.

 Example sed command: `sed -i '' 's/{{GROUP_NAME}}/Inline ASM/g' ./**/*.md`
 *Note* the `-i ''` is important as it is required on some platforms e.g. macOS

 * {{GROUP_NAME}} -> The display name of your group e.g. "Inline ASM".
 * {{GROUP_SLUG}} -> The url slug name of your group used for
   `rust-lang/team` and repo name. e.g. "pg-inline-asm".
 * {{CHAT_PLATFORM}} -> The name of your chat app e.g. "Zulip".
 * {{CHAT_LINK}} -> The hyperlink to your discussions on the chat app
   e.g. "https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/216763-project-inline-asm".

## How Can I Get Involved?

**FIX ME**

<!--
 List ways that people from outside your group can get involved and potentially
 become members, include what meetings your team has, and how a person could
 start participating and contributing. Make sure to mention the main platform
 your group hosts its discussions. Be sure to also include links to any
 other projects that your group maintains.
-->

[You can find a list of the current members available
on `rust-lang/team`.][team-toml]

If you'd like to participate be sure to check out any of our [open issues] on this
repository.

We also participate on [{{CHAT_PLATFORM}}][chat-link], feel free to introduce
yourself over there and ask us any questions you have.
